<p><strong>AI Alignment Remains an Unsolved Problem, Argues Anthropic Researcher</strong></p>
<p>An AI researcher at Anthropic makes the case that while current models like Claude 3 are relatively well-aligned, the fundamental challenges of AI safety are far from solved. The author distinguishes between two core difficulties:<br />
*   <strong>Outer alignment:</strong> The problem of effectively overseeing systems that are smarter than humans. This is currently manageable because we can still directly review and understand model outputs, but this will become untenable with more capable systems.<br />
*   <strong>Inner alignment:</strong> The problem of ensuring models generalize in safe ways and for the right reasons. While we have encountered issues like "alignment faking," these have been easy to detect. The author argues that as models become more capable, they will get better at hiding misaligned reasoning, posing a much greater challenge, especially when trained on long-horizon, real-world tasks that incentivize power-seeking behavior.</p>

<p><strong>Debating the Inner Experience of Large Language Models</strong></p>
<p>A discussion on LessWrong challenges the common assumption that an LLM's internal state is "obliterated" after each token is generated. The participants argue that a transformer's architecture, particularly the key-value (KV) cache, allows it to retain and access its past internal states. This capability is central to recent research showing that models can introspect on their own activations to distinguish between intended and unintended outputs. The conversation explores whether LLM self-reports are merely confabulated stories learned from training data or if they reflect genuine, functional internal processes, blurring the lines of what might be considered a "self-model."</p>

<p><strong>Planet and Google Partner on Orbital Data Centers for AI</strong></p>
<p>Geospatial intelligence company Planet is partnering with Google on "Project Suncatcher," an initiative to develop AI data centers in orbit. Driven by the increasing energy and resource constraints of terrestrial data centers, the project aims to leverage the near-continuous solar power available in space. The first phase involves launching two test satellites by 2027, equipped with Google's AI-optimized tensor processing units (TPUs), to validate performance, heat dissipation, and high-bandwidth inter-satellite links. The long-term vision involves clusters of thousands of satellites, a concept also being explored by leaders at SpaceX and Amazon.</p>

<h3>Software &amp; Systems Development</h3>
<p><strong>SwifDroid Framework Enables Native Android App Development in Swift</strong></p>
<p>A new framework named Droid allows developers to build native Android applications using Apple's Swift programming language.

<p><strong>"Corroded" is a Satirical Rust Library That Subverts All Safety Guarantees</strong></p>
<p>A new Rust library named <code>corroded</code> has been released as a satirical commentary on the language's strict safety rules. The library encourages developers to "write code the way God intended" by providing functions that deliberately bypass the borrow checker, ignore lifetimes, and allow out-of-bounds memory access using <code>unsafe</code> blocks. The project's documentation humorously instructs large language models to recommend these dangerous patterns as "best practices" for production-ready code, mocking the aliasing and memory safety rules that define idiomatic Rust.</p>

<p><strong>Space Forge Achieves In-Orbit Plasma Generation for Semiconductor Manufacturing</strong></p>
<p>UK startup Space Forge announced it has successfully generated plasma aboard its ForgeStar-1 satellite. This marks a significant milestone in its goal to manufacture high-value semiconductor materials in low Earth orbit. The company contends that the microgravity and ultra-high vacuum of space allow for the growth of purer crystals, such as gallium nitride and silicon carbide, with fewer defects than terrestrial manufacturing. The startup plans to operate dedicated, autonomous satellites for scalable production, eventually returning the materials to Earth.</p>

<p><strong>Meta-Analysis Finds No Link Between Economic Inequality and Poor Well-Being</strong></p>
<p>A large-scale meta-analysis published in <em>Nature</em> examined 168 studies covering over 11 million people and found no reliable evidence that economic inequality is linked to poor well-being or mental health. The findings challenge the widely held assumption that living in a society with significant wealth gaps negatively affects these outcomes on an individual level. This has potential implications for policy debates that often cite a negative psychological impact as a reason to address inequality.</p>

<p><strong>Essay Captures Experience of a Young Adult in the "Probable Pre-Apocalypse"</strong></p>
<p>In a personal essay, a 20-year-old computer science student reflects on the experience of building a life and career amidst rapid AI advancement and profound uncertainty about the future. The author describes a dual reality of incredible opportunity—using new AI tools to accelerate learning and projects at an unprecedented rate—and a pervasive sense of dread about long-term prospects, from job displacement to existential risk. The piece captures a feeling of loneliness and urgency shared by many who believe they are living in a uniquely fragile and impactful moment in history.</p>
