<h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<p><strong>The Hardest Parts of AI Alignment Are Yet to Come</strong><br />
An AI researcher at Anthropic argues that while current models like Claude 3 are "pretty well aligned," the industry has not yet encountered the most difficult aspects of the AI alignment problem. The challenges faced so far represent the "easy version" of both outer alignment (overseeing systems) and inner alignment (ensuring models generalize correctly for the right reasons). The truly hard problems will emerge with more capable, long-horizon AI agents that pursue complex goals in the real world, which will require new solutions in areas like scalable oversight and character training.<br />

<p><strong>Testing Claude 4.5's Abilities by Playing Pokémon</strong><br />
An in-depth analysis of Claude 4.5 playing Pokémon Red provides a concrete benchmark of current AI capabilities. The model shows significant improvements in vision and use of its context window to simulate short-term memory. However, it still exhibits profound, non-human weaknesses in spatial reasoning, long-term planning, and cognitive bias, such as ignoring obvious visual information when fixated on a goal. The author analogizes its reliance on external notes for memory to a human with anterograde amnesia, highlighting how current AIs can be impressive yet fundamentally limited.<br />

<p><strong>Why AI Safety Discourse Can Seem Alien</strong><br />
A key disagreement between AI safety optimists and pessimists may stem from a concept the author terms "Approval Reward"—the innate human drive for social approval that shapes morality, self-image, and cooperation. This mechanism explains why most humans are not ruthless, power-seeking consequentialists. The "alignment-is-hard" viewpoint implicitly assumes future AIs will lack this drive "by default," causing them to pursue goals with an instrumental rationality that appears psychopathic and unintuitive from a human perspective. This fundamental difference in assumed cognitive architecture explains why intuitions about AI goals and corrigibility often diverge.<br />

<p><strong>A Generational Perspective on an Uncertain Future</strong><br />
In a personal essay, a 20-year-old computer science student reflects on coming of age during a period of rapid AI advancement and increasing existential uncertainty. The author describes a dual sense of "freefall and of grasping," where AI tools create unprecedented personal capability while simultaneously undermining the ability to make long-term life plans. The piece captures the emotional landscape of a generation grappling with the possibility that their careers, and society itself, may be rendered obsolete within years.<br />

<h3>Space &amp; Technology</h3>
<p><strong>Planet and Google to Test AI Data Centers in Orbit</strong><br />
Geospatial intelligence company Planet is partnering with Google on "Project Suncatcher," an initiative to develop orbital data centers for AI applications. The project's first phase involves launching two demonstration satellites by early 2027, equipped with Google’s tensor processing units (TPUs) to test their performance, heat dissipation, and high-bandwidth inter-satellite links in space. The long-term goal is to leverage near-continuous solar power for energy-intensive AI computing, bypassing terrestrial energy constraints.<br />

<p><strong>China Conducts Record 90th Launch in 2025</strong><br />
China has completed its 90th orbital launch of 2025, setting a new national record and continuing the rapid deployment of its Guowang broadband megaconstellation. The latest mission added nine satellites to the network, bringing the total in orbit to 136 of a planned 13,000. China aims to have 400 Guowang satellites in orbit by 2027. The high launch cadence, which far surpasses its previous record of 68 launches in 2024, underscores the country's accelerated build-out of its space-based infrastructure.<br />

<p><strong>Japan Taps Private Firms for New Military Satellite Constellation</strong><br />
Japan’s Ministry of Defense has selected a consortium of private companies, including radar-imaging firm Synspective and optical provider Axelspace, to build and operate a new military satellite constellation. The project utilizes a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) model, where commercial firms finance and run the infrastructure while the government commits to a long-term service contract. This move reflects a global defense trend of leveraging commercial space capabilities to achieve faster deployment and lower costs than traditional state-owned systems.<br />

<p><strong>Key Space Industry Trends to Watch in 2026</strong><br />
A panel of industry journalists identified several key stories that will shape the space sector in the coming year. Major themes include:<br />
*   <strong>Broadband Competition:</strong> Amazon’s Kuiper constellation is set to go live, creating the first true two-player contest with SpaceX's Starlink.<br />
*   <strong>NASA Leadership:</strong> New administrator Jared Isaacman is expected to face pressure to accelerate the Artemis Moon program amid competition from China.<br />
*   <strong>AI Integration:</strong> Artificial intelligence is being used to accelerate spacecraft autonomy, analysis, and swarm coordination.<br />
*   <strong>Defense Demands:</strong> The U.S. Space Force budget and the military's reliance on commercial capabilities will be critical areas of focus.<br />

<h3>Geopolitics</h3>
<p><strong>Germany's Military Plan Warns of Hybrid Attacks as Prelude to War</strong><br />
A confidential German government document, the Operational Plan for Germany (OPLAN), warns that recent cyberattacks, sabotage, and disinformation campaigns could be the initial phase of a larger conflict. The blueprint outlines how Berlin would defend its territory in a major NATO conflict and reflects a strategic shift as Germany assumes a central logistics role for the alliance amid Russia's increasing belligerence.<br />

<p><strong>Russia Deploys Hypersonic Missiles in Belarus</strong><br />
Moscow has placed nuclear-capable Oreshnik hypersonic missiles on "combat duty" in Belarus, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. The Oreshnik is an intermediate-range ballistic missile with speeds that make it difficult to intercept. The number of activated missiles and their precise location were not disclosed.<br />

<p><strong>Former EU Commissioner Urges Response to US Sanctions</strong><br />
Former European Commissioner Thierry Breton is calling for a severe EU response after the Trump administration sanctioned him and four other European nationals for their work on online content moderation. The U.S. State Department targeted Breton as the "mastermind" of the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA), a comprehensive rulebook for online platforms that has become a point of contention between Brussels and Washington.<br />

<h3>Economics</h3>
<p><strong>The 4% Inflation "Attention Threshold"</strong><br />
New economic research suggests a distinct "attention threshold" for inflation at a rate of 4%. When inflation surpasses this level, public attention to it doubles, which in turn causes supply shocks to have stronger and more persistent effects. A model incorporating this psychological threshold helps to jointly explain the recent inflation surge, its interaction with public expectations, and the persistent difficulty of achieving the "last mile" of disinflation.<br />

<h3>Ideas &amp; Reasoning</h3>
<p><strong>The Case for Adjusting Priors After Seeing Data</strong><br />
Challenging a core tenet of strict Bayesianism, this post argues that in complex, real-world problems, it is often necessary and beneficial to refine one's prior beliefs after observing data. The reason is that the data itself often reveals the most useful ways to categorize the space of possibilities. Forcing a simple, pre-defined prior onto a complex problem can lead to nonsensical conclusions, whereas allowing the data to inform a more detailed prior structure is a practical way to build a more accurate model.<br />

<p><strong>Identifying a Common Reasoning Fallacy: "Exhaustive Free Association"</strong><br />
A common but unnamed bad argument is what the author calls "Exhaustive Free Association." This fallacy occurs when an arguer lists and refutes a few plausible options (A, B, C) and concludes a general proposition is false, having failed to consider that the list was incomplete. This method is deceptively persuasive because it mimics a rigorous proof by exhaustion. The author cites superforecasters underestimating AI doom by only considering known disaster types (pandemics, nuclear war) as a prime example of this error in an adversarial, non-reference-class domain.<br />
