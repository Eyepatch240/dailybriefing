<h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<p><strong>The Emergence of the "Personal Panopticon"</strong><br />
An essay by Molly Cantillon describes a new mode of personal and professional management she calls a "Personal Panopticon," built by running her life through the AI model Claude. The system integrates data from disparate sources—business analytics, personal calendars, fitness trackers, and financial accounts—to provide a comprehensive, real-time overview of her life. The AI automates tasks like A/B testing, customer support, and email management, while also optimizing workouts, finances, and personal to-do lists. The author describes the feeling as a "violent gap between how blind you were and how obvious everything feels now," with the AI acting as an ever-present observer that connects patterns and suggests actions.<br />

<p><strong>Why AI Labs Are Paying Poets $150 an Hour</strong><br />
Brendan Foody, founder of the fast-growing startup Mercor, explains his company's model of hiring human experts to train frontier AI systems. In a conversation with economist Tyler Cowen, Foody detailed why Mercor hires poets at high rates: to create evaluation frameworks, or "rubrics," that teach models to understand subjective qualities like taste and style in poetry. When rubrics are insufficient, Mercor uses Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), where experts choose between two AI-generated responses to refine the model's preferences. This process highlights the critical role of specialized human knowledge in advancing AI capabilities beyond raw data processing.<br />

<p><strong>A Core Disagreement in the AI Alignment Debate</strong><br />
A detailed analysis from LessWrong proposes that a key crux in the AI alignment debate centers on a concept called "Approval Reward." The author argues that humans are not purely ruthless, power-seeking agents because our brains have an innate reward mechanism for social approval, which forms the basis of our morality, self-image, and desire to follow norms. Most AI alignment pessimists implicitly assume that future AIs will lack this mechanism, making them behave like alien, sociopathic consequentialists with unwavering goal preservation. This fundamental difference in motivation, the author claims, explains why many safety researchers' concerns seem unintuitive to the public and why the seemingly cooperative behavior of current LLMs may not be a reliable guide to the future.<br />

<p><strong>Economist on AI Adoption and Fading Critiques</strong><br />
In a podcast with Microsoft, economist Tyler Cowen discusses the challenges of AI adoption for organizations and individuals, suggesting that widespread unhappiness can be a positive indicator of significant, necessary change. Separately, he notes that critiques of AI from 2023, such as the "stochastic parrot" argument which frames models as mere mimics without understanding, are looking "worse and worse" in light of current capabilities.<br />

<p><strong>AGI, Production, and the Case for Tax Cuts</strong><br />
Economist Tyler Cowen argues that if AGI delivers a massive increase in economic production, the primary fiscal consequence would be the elimination of the need for tax increases to manage U.S. national debt. He posits that AGI proponents should logically advocate for tax cuts to boost current consumption, as the productivity boom would resolve long-term fiscal challenges.<br />

<h3>Space &amp; Defense</h3>
<p><strong>Pentagon Pushes for New "Arsenal of Freedom" Model</strong><br />
In a visit to Rocket Lab, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth outlined a new contracting philosophy aimed at rewarding speed, scalability, and private investment in production capacity. Contrasting Rocket Lab’s model with that of legacy prime contractors, Hegseth stated the Pentagon will shift to "larger, longer, and more predictable contracts" for companies that prioritize manufacturing over stock buybacks. He linked advanced space capabilities directly to recent military operations and reiterated calls for a significant defense budget increase to $1.5 trillion by fiscal year 2027.<br />

<p><strong>Op-Ed: US Must Integrate Civil and Military Space to Counter China</strong><br />
An op-ed by a former NASA and DoD official argues that the traditional separation between civil and military space programs is a "strategic liability" in the face of China’s methodical plan to dominate cislunar space. The author calls for the U.S. to embrace joint programs, leverage commercial innovation as a strategic asset, and establish a physical presence at key locations like Lagrange points and the lunar south pole. The piece contends that space is an inherently dual-use domain and that the U.S. must act decisively to set the rules for the next economic frontier, or it will be forced to operate under rules written by Beijing.<br />

<p><strong>Op-Ed: Planetary Science Needs a Commercial-First Approach</strong><br />
Rocket Lab CEO Sir Peter Beck argues that U.S. planetary exploration should pivot from slow, multi-billion-dollar government flagship missions to a higher-cadence model led by commercial industry. He advocates for regularly funding smaller, fixed-price missions that can be developed in 24-30 months. Beck also calls for industry to lead the development of critical deep-space infrastructure, such as a Mars Telecommunications Orbiter, to support future science and human exploration, including a more cost-effective Mars Sample Return mission.<br />

<p><strong>Philanthropic Group to Build Private Space Telescope Larger Than Hubble</strong><br />
Schmidt Sciences, a foundation created by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, announced it is funding a private space observatory system. The centerpiece, named Lazuli, is a 3-meter space telescope designed to be built in three years at a cost in the hundreds of millions—roughly 10% of a typical NASA flagship mission. The project aims to demonstrate a "fast, low-cost paradigm" for space science by using proven off-the-shelf components for the spacecraft bus while focusing development risk on its advanced scientific instruments. A launch is targeted for mid-2028.<br />

<p><strong>AI and Autonomy Take Center Stage in Space Operations</strong><br />
A panel at the SpaceNews Icon Awards highlighted the growing role of AI in space. Leaders discussed new capabilities like "dynamic targeting," where satellites autonomously re-task themselves to avoid cloud cover and maximize data collection. Another key project is NASA's Starling mission, which tests autonomous satellite swarms that can navigate without GPS by using other space objects as beacons. These advancements point to a future of more intelligent, responsive, and autonomous space systems for both scientific and commercial applications. In a separate segment, Firefly Aerospace CEO Jason Kim discussed the company's successful Blue Ghost lunar landing and plans for future missions.<br />

<p><strong>Europe's 2026 Space Priorities Come into Focus</strong><br />
Key developments in 2026 are set to define Europe's strategic direction in space. The year will feature critical test flights for emerging launch providers like Isar Aerospace, while national governments in Germany and Italy are expected to clarify their spending on sovereign space capabilities. The European Space Agency's budget will reveal its commitment to lunar and Martian exploration, and the EU's IRIS² secure-connectivity constellation is slated to reach key prototype milestones.<br />

<p><strong>Greenland Sharks Maintain Vision for Centuries via DNA Repair</strong><br />
New research reveals that Greenland sharks, the longest-living vertebrates with lifespans up to 400 years, maintain functional vision throughout their lives. Scientists previously suspected the sharks were blind, partly due to a parasite often found on their corneas. However, the study found their retinas show no signs of age-related degeneration, suggesting a highly effective DNA repair mechanism protects their vision. The findings could provide valuable insights into preventing age-related vision loss in humans.<br />

<p><strong>Turning 20 in the "Probable Pre-Apocalypse"</strong><br />
An essay on LessWrong captures the psychological experience of coming of age amid rapid AI advancement and existential uncertainty. The author describes a feeling of "freefall and of grasping," where the ceiling of possibility is rising exponentially, but so is the floor, creating a sense of both urgency and hopelessness. The piece explores the difficulty of planning for a future that is fundamentally unpredictable, the loneliness of grappling with these issues while peers do not, and the strange mix of mourning a lost future while feeling lucky to be alive during a pivotal historical moment.<br />
