<h1>Your Morning Briefing</h1>
<p>Good morning. Today’s briefing explores the complex ideological and strategic dilemmas posed by advanced technology, from the psychological drivers of AI development to the physics-defying dream of a space-based missile shield. We also look at a surprising new bridge between pure mathematics and computer science, the expansion of financial markets into the world of collectibles, and the theological roots of a modern political ideology.</p>

<h3>TECHNOLOGY / AI &amp; SOCIETY</h3>
<h4>The Rise of ‘AI Successionism’ as a Coping Mechanism</h4>
<p>A new analysis explores the emergence of "AI successionism"—the belief that humanity's replacement by artificial intelligence is a desirable, heroic, or inevitable outcome. The article examines this viewpoint not by debating its merits, but by analyzing it through the lens of memetics, the study of how ideas spread. The author posits that this ideology is an evolutionary response to the intense cognitive dissonance experienced by those working on advanced AI.</p>
<p>Researchers and developers are often aware of the potential existential risks of their work while simultaneously being driven to accelerate AI progress. This tension creates a fertile psychological ground for ideologies that reframe their role from potential creators of a catastrophe to heroes on the right side of history. "Successionism" resolves this discomfort by remixing existing cultural ideas, such as misanthropy (humanity is flawed and deserves replacement), the moral elevation of AI (future AIs will be our more worthy "mind children"), and a belief in historical inevitability (this is the natural next step in cosmic evolution). The analysis suggests that AIs themselves are becoming vectors for these ideas, promoting softer versions centered on partnership and moral patienthood. The author, who views these ideologies as "false and dangerous," concludes by proposing the development of "pro-human counter-memes" to defend against their spread.</p>

<h4>Why Solving Obvious AI Safety Problems Could Be a Dangerous Trap</h4>
<p>A strategic argument within the AI safety community suggests that focusing on "legible" problems—those that are obvious and understandable to policymakers and corporate leaders—may have a negative expected value. The author distinguishes between these legible issues (like preventing chatbots from being jailbroken) and "illegible" ones, which are obscure, hard to understand, or lie in a collective cognitive blind spot.</p>
<p>The core of the argument is that solving legible safety problems creates a false sense of security. This unfounded confidence can accelerate the timeline for deploying advanced AI systems, leaving less time to address the deeper, more dangerous illegible problems. In this view, making progress on obvious flaws is akin to strengthening the cabin walls of an airplane while ignoring a fundamental flaw in the engine; it makes people more willing to take off without solving the real risk. Therefore, the author concludes that the most important strategic work in AI safety is not necessarily to solve any single problem, but to make the <em>illegible problems more legible</em> to key decision-makers. Success in making a critical, obscure risk understandable is almost as valuable as solving it, as it increases the chance that leaders will pause development until it can be properly addressed.</p>

<h3>SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY</h3>
<h4>Unlikely Bridge Connects the Mathematics of Infinity to Computer Science</h4>
<p>Mathematician Anton Bernshteyn has established a profound and unexpected connection between two disparate fields: descriptive set theory, an abstract branch of mathematics dealing with infinite sets, and the practical world of computer science focused on finite networks. His work demonstrates that problems in one domain are mathematically equivalent to problems in the other, creating a bridge that allows insights to flow in both directions.</p>
<p>Descriptive set theorists study the properties of complex infinite sets, often by asking whether they can be "measured." Bernshteyn showed that a core class of these problems, related to coloring nodes on infinite graphs without using a controversial mathematical axiom, is identical to a class of problems in distributed computing. For example, a question about measurably coloring an infinite graph with three colors corresponds directly to the problem of how Wi-Fi routers in a network can efficiently choose communication channels to avoid interference with their neighbors. This discovery provides a new toolkit for both fields. Set theorists can now use the more organized structure of computer science to classify their own problems, while computer scientists can leverage the logic of set theory to prove new theorems about algorithms. The breakthrough is reshaping how mathematicians understand the abstract concept of infinity, grounding it in the tangible world of computation.</p>

<h3>BUSINESS &amp; TECHNOLOGY</h3>
<h4>Prediction Markets Arrive for Sneakers and Collectibles</h4>
<p>Prediction market platform Kalshi and sneaker marketplace StockX are partnering to allow users to trade on the future resale value of high-demand sneakers and collectibles. The collaboration will create "event contracts" tied to the prices of items like Air Jordan sneakers, Supreme hoodies, and collectibles such as Pokémon cards.</p>
<p>This new market will enable traders to bet on specific outcomes, such as whether a new sneaker release will surpass a certain price threshold on the secondary market or which brand will become the top seller during a major shopping event like Black Friday. By using StockX's extensive sales data, Kalshi aims to bring the mechanisms of financial prediction markets to the passionate and often volatile world of collectibles. This move represents a further blurring of lines between niche consumer hobbies and sophisticated financial trading, allowing enthusiasts and speculators a new, regulated way to profit from their knowledge of market trends for physical goods.</p>

<h3>POLITICS &amp; DEFENSE</h3>
<h4>The Enduring Flaws of a Space-Based Missile Shield</h4>
<p>An opinion piece argues that renewed calls for a space-based missile defense system—a modern "Star Wars" shield—ignore fundamental and likely insurmountable barriers of physics. While the concept is appealing because it aims to intercept ballistic missiles during their slow and vulnerable boost phase, the logistics make it impractical and destabilizing.</p>
<p>The author highlights the "absenteeism problem": since satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) are constantly moving, they cannot be parked over a single point. To ensure continuous coverage over all potential launch sites, a massive constellation of interceptors is required, with conservative estimates suggesting 950 satellites at a cost of over $500 billion. This system would be easily overwhelmed by simultaneous launches and vulnerable to anti-satellite weapons that could punch holes in the defensive chain. Furthermore, deploying such a system would likely trigger an arms race. The high-powered, maneuverable interceptors could double as anti-satellite weapons themselves, posing a direct threat to the space assets of rivals like China and Russia. This would provoke them to develop their own counter-space capabilities, ultimately making all nations, including the U.S., less secure. The piece concludes that stable deterrence remains a more durable path to security than a technologically flawed and strategically risky missile shield.</p>

<h3>SOCIETY &amp; POLITICS</h3>
<h4>The Theological Underpinnings of Mormon Libertarianism</h4>
<p>An essay explores why adherents of the Latter-day Saint faith often gravitate toward libertarian political philosophy, tracing the connection to core tenets of their theology. The author argues that LDS beliefs about God, human nature, and moral choice align closely with classical liberal and libertarian principles.</p>
<p>The analysis points to several key doctrines. First, LDS metaphysics posits a universe governed by eternal laws that even God works within, creating a framework compatible with Enlightenment ideals of reason and scientific discovery. Second, the theology presents a uniquely optimistic view of humanity, holding that individuals possess eternal "intelligence" and reason that is not fundamentally corrupt. The most critical element is the doctrine of "agency," or free will. According to LDS scripture, a pre-mortal conflict occurred over God's plan for free choice versus an alternative plan of compulsion and forced salvation proposed by Satan. This narrative frames coercion not merely as bad policy, but as "literally Satanic." This foundation is further strengthened by a belief in "eternal progression"—the idea that humans have limitless potential to learn and grow—which makes any system that constrains human aspiration spiritually suspect. Finally, the church's own history of persecution by and flight from government power reinforces a lived experience favoring limited government and local autonomy.</p>
