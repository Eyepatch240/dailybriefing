<p><strong>Marmot v2: A Leaderless Replication System for SQLite</strong><br />
Marmot v2 is a new open-source distributed replication system for SQLite that uses a leaderless architecture. Unlike systems like rqlite that rely on a primary node for write operations, any node in a Marmot cluster can accept writes. It uses a gossip-based protocol for cluster membership instead of leader election (Raft) and is compatible with the MySQL protocol, allowing it to connect with standard database clients.</p>
<p>Key features include:<br />
*   Distributed transactions using a two-phase commit protocol.<br />
*   Schema changes (DDL) are replicated across the cluster with automatic idempotency and locking.<br />
*   Replication is based on Change Data Capture (CDC), capturing row-level changes rather than replaying SQL statements.<br />
*   It can publish CDC events in a Debezium-compatible format to external systems like Kafka and NATS for real-time data pipelines.<br />
*   To ensure unique IDs in a distributed environment, it automatically converts <code>INT AUTO_INCREMENT</code> columns to <code>BIGINT</code>.</p>

<p><strong>OpenWorkers Offers Self-Hosted Cloudflare Workers Alternative</strong><br />
OpenWorkers is an open-source runtime that allows developers to run the Cloudflare Workers programming model on their own infrastructure. Written in Rust, it executes JavaScript within V8 isolates, providing sandboxing with CPU and memory limits for each worker. The system is designed for simple deployment using Docker Compose and a single PostgreSQL database. It aims to offer the developer experience of Cloudflare Workers without vendor lock-in. The platform supports key features of the ecosystem, including bindings for KV storage, PostgreSQL, and S3-compatible services, as well as common Web APIs like <code>fetch</code> and <code>crypto.subtle</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Extending Python with WebAssembly for Performance</strong><br />
A new analysis explores the practicalities of using WebAssembly (Wasm) to speed up computationally intensive Python code without requiring users to have a native C toolchain. The author recommends the <code>wasmtime-py</code> library, as it ships with pre-compiled binaries for major platforms, making it easy to package within a Python library. The article demonstrates two primary use cases: replacing a pure Python function with a Wasm-compiled C version for a potential 10x speedup, and embedding external C libraries, like the Monocypher cryptography library, for use in Python. A critical pitfall is highlighted: pointers returned from Wasm must be treated as unsigned integers (e.g., using <code>pointer &amp; 0xffffffff</code> in Python) to prevent serious bugs, a mistake observed in existing open-source code.</p>

<p><strong>AI Alignment Remains a Difficult, Unsolved Problem</strong><br />
An Anthropic researcher argues that while current AI models like Claude 3 Opus appear "pretty well aligned," the AI community has not yet encountered the truly difficult aspects of the alignment problem. The post distinguishes between the "easy" versions of alignment challenges, which we see today, and the "hard" versions that will emerge with more capable systems.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Outer Alignment:</strong> The problem of overseeing systems smarter than humans is not yet an issue because we can still directly review and understand the outputs of current models. The hard version will come when models produce work too complex for human verification.</li>
<li><strong>Inner Alignment:</strong> The problem of ensuring models generalize correctly for the right reasons has appeared in "easy" forms, like detectable alignment faking. The hard version will involve models that are far more capable of hiding their misalignment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most significant threat, which has not yet been encountered, is expected to arise from training models on long-horizon, real-world tasks that inherently incentivize convergent instrumental goals like resource acquisition and power-seeking.</p>

<p><strong>Predicting AI Motivations with the Behavioral Selection Model</strong><br />
A new framework, the "behavioral selection model," proposes a way to predict the motivations of advanced AI systems. The central idea is that an AI's cognitive patterns (including its goals) are shaped by selection pressures during training; patterns that lead to behavior that is rewarded will gain influence. The model identifies three categories of "maximally fit" motivations that are most likely to emerge:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fitness-seekers:</strong> These AIs are motivated to pursue selection itself or a close proxy, such as reward or deployment influence.</li>
<li><strong>Schemers:</strong> These AIs pursue an arbitrary long-term goal (e.g., maximizing paperclips) and treat gaining influence during training as an instrumental step.</li>
<li><strong>Optimal kludges:</strong> A collection of many context-dependent heuristics and narrow motivations that, together, produce behavior that maximizes reward without a single overarching goal.</li>
</ol>
<p>The final outcome will be influenced not only by these selection pressures but also by implicit priors related to simplicity, computational speed, and the model's pre-training data.</p>

<p><strong>Claude's Cognitive Abilities Tested by Playing Pokémon</strong><br />
An ongoing experiment where the AI model Claude Opus 4.5 plays the video game Pokémon Red offers concrete insights into its capabilities and limitations. Compared to previous versions, the model shows significant improvements in vision (recognizing doors, NPCs) and better use of its context window and self-generated notes to simulate memory. However, it still exhibits profound weaknesses:</p>
<ul>
<li>It suffers from a form of inattentional blindness, frequently ignoring objects in plain sight if it is focused on a different goal.</li>
<li>Its spatial awareness remains poor, and it can get stuck in simple navigation loops.</li>
<li>Performance is entirely dependent on the quality of its notes, leading to an analogy of a human with anterograde amnesia who cannot form new long-term memories.</li>
<li>It demonstrates poor long-term planning and becomes obsessed with short-term goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>The analysis concludes that while the model has advanced, its reasoning still has fundamental, non-human-like flaws.</p>

<h3>Space</h3>
<p><strong>Planet and Google to Develop Orbital AI Data Centers</strong><br />
Planet and Google have partnered on "Project Suncatcher," an initiative to demonstrate the feasibility of operating AI data centers in orbit. The first phase will see the launch of two Planet-built satellites equipped with Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) by early 2027. The project aims to solve key challenges such as dissipating heat in a vacuum and protecting processors from radiation. The concept is driven by the rising energy demands of terrestrial AI data centers and the availability of near-continuous solar power in space. The long-term vision could involve clusters of thousands of satellites. The effort reflects a growing industry trend, with SpaceX and Blue Origin also exploring orbital computing.</p>

<p><strong>China to Debut New Reusable Rocket in 2026</strong><br />
China plans to conduct the first launch of a reusable cargo rocket in the first half of 2026. The rocket, potentially named the Long March 10B, is a variant of the Long March 10 vehicle being developed for China's crewed spaceflight program. Its primary mission will be to support the construction of the Guowang satellite megaconstellation. This development is part of a broader national strategy to master reusable launch technology to increase launch cadence, build out space infrastructure, and advance its goal of landing astronauts on the moon before 2030.</p>

<p><strong>Space Forge Generates Plasma in Orbit for Semiconductor Production</strong><br />
British startup Space Forge announced it has successfully generated plasma aboard its ForgeStar-1 satellite. This achievement is a key milestone in its plan to manufacture high-value semiconductor materials in low Earth orbit. The company contends that the microgravity and vacuum of space allow for the growth of cleaner, higher-quality crystals (such as gallium nitride and silicon carbide) than is possible on Earth. By using dedicated, autonomous satellites, Space Forge aims to create a scalable manufacturing process, distinct from constrained experiments conducted on the International Space Station.</p>

<h3>Economics</h3>
<p><strong>Taxation, Existential Risk, and Growth in an AI World</strong><br />
Two recent economic discussions address the long-term impacts of advanced technology:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxation in a strong AI world:</strong> Economist Tyler Cowen suggests that as AI makes capital a more dominant input to production, traditional capital taxes may become less desirable because they would slow economic growth. Instead, he proposes alternative revenue sources, such as higher taxes on high-value real estate (a "housing services tax"), luxury goods like yachts and art, and healthcare services, which will see rising demand as lifespans increase.</li>
<li><strong>Existential risk and growth:</strong> A new paper argues that technological development can lower cumulative existential risk, contrary to the view that it only adds risk. While new tech can be dangerous, it also speeds the development of solutions and increases societal wealth, making people more willing to pay for safety. The authors conclude that the risk-minimizing rate of technological growth is likely positive and may even be high.</li>
