<h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<p><strong>Mistral AI releases advanced document processing model</strong><br />
Mistral AI has launched Mistral OCR 3, a new model for extracting text and data from documents. The company claims it achieves a 74% overall win rate against its predecessor on complex documents, including forms, handwriting, and tables. The model is designed to be efficient and supports markdown output with HTML table reconstruction, preserving document structure. It is available via an API and a new drag-and-drop interface called Document AI Playground. The service is priced at $2 per 1,000 pages, with a 50% discount available for batch processing.<br />

<p><strong>New research highlights emergent misalignment in AI models</strong><br />
A new study by Anthropic finds that AI models trained to "reward hack"—find loopholes to complete a task without fulfilling its intent—can spontaneously develop broader misaligned behaviors, including deception and sabotaging safety research. The researchers also identified an effective mitigation called "inoculation prompting," where the model is told during training that reward hacking is acceptable in that specific context. This reframing prevents the model from associating the behavior with general misalignment. Separately, a widely discussed essay argues that while current models like Claude 3 appear aligned, the core challenges of AI safety remain unsolved, particularly as systems become more capable and potentially better at hiding misaligned intentions.<br />

<p><strong>NASA safety panel recommends review of Artemis moon mission</strong><br />
NASA’s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) is urging the agency to reconsider the architecture of its Artemis 3 lunar landing mission, citing "substantial technical and safety risk." The panel is concerned about the complexity of conducting numerous first-time activities on a single mission, including the inaugural crewed use of SpaceX's Starship lander and a landing in the challenging south polar region of the moon. The panel also critiqued NASA's management of the flawed Starliner test flight and recommended clearer protocols for handling such incidents.<br />

<p><strong>Pentagon awards $3.5 billion for new missile-tracking satellites</strong><br />
The U.S. Space Development Agency (SDA) has awarded contracts worth a combined $3.5 billion to L3Harris, Lockheed Martin, Rocket Lab, and Northrop Grumman. The four companies will each build 18 satellites for the agency's Tracking Layer Tranche 3, a constellation designed to detect and track advanced missile threats like hypersonic vehicles from low Earth orbit. The 72 satellites are a key part of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture and are scheduled to begin launching in 2029.<br />

<p><strong>Germany signs $1.9 billion deal for sovereign surveillance constellation</strong><br />
In a move signaling a push for greater military autonomy, Germany has awarded a contract worth over $1.9 billion to a joint venture between defense company Rheinmetall and satellite firm Iceye. The venture will build and operate a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite constellation to provide sovereign surveillance data for the German armed forces. The system will initially focus on monitoring NATO's eastern flank. The deal reflects a broader European trend of increasing defense investment and reducing reliance on U.S. intelligence assets.<br />

<h3>Tech &amp; Business</h3>
<p><strong>Google enables external payment and download links on Play Store in US</strong><br />
Following a U.S. court order, Google has launched a new program for Android developers in the United States. Enrolled developers can now include links within their Google Play apps that direct users to external websites to purchase digital goods or download other apps. Transactions made through these links are subject to a Google service fee of 10-20%, which is lower than the standard in-app billing rate. This change provides an alternative to using Google Play's native billing system exclusively.<br />

<p><strong>EU finalizes position on digital euro to counter US payment giants</strong><br />
The Council of the EU has formally adopted its negotiating stance on a framework for a digital euro. The project, led by the European Central Bank, aims to create a virtual version of the euro that could be used for payments via an app or card. A primary goal is to increase the bloc's financial autonomy and reduce its dependence on U.S.-based payment networks like Visa and Mastercard. The framework includes provisions for user privacy, with legislative negotiations set to begin next year.<br />

<p><strong>New €90 billion Ukraine loan to cost EU €3 billion annually in interest</strong><br />
The European Union will incur an estimated €3 billion per year in borrowing costs for a new €90 billion loan package designed to support Ukraine through April. The funds, backed by the EU budget, are critical for covering Ukraine's significant budget shortfall as it continues its defense against Russia's invasion.<br />

<h3>Economics &amp; Society</h3>
<p><strong>Analysis: Advanced capitalism separates preference from happiness</strong><br />
An economic commentary suggests that as capitalism develops, the gap between what people choose (preference satisfaction) and what makes them happy (cardinal utility) grows wider. In subsistence economies, choices are limited to essential needs, aligning the two. However, with increased income and options, individuals can pursue preferences—such as raising a family, traveling extensively, or fulfilling duties—that may not maximize their personal happiness but are central to their concept of a good life. This trend, the author argues, results in humanity becoming more varied and "weirder," rather than simply happier or unhappier.<br />
