<p><strong>A Look Back at the Key AI Trends of 2025</strong><br />
In a comprehensive (and speculative) year-end review dated December 31, 2025, technology analyst Simon Willison outlines the major developments that shaped the large language model (LLM) landscape. Key trends include the rise of "reasoning" models, which excel at multi-step tasks and tool use, making AI-assisted search and coding significantly more effective. This led to the year of "agents," particularly for coding, with products like Anthropic's Claude Code and OpenAI's Codex driving massive developer adoption and revenue. The report also notes the emergence of $200/month subscription tiers for power users, the dominance of Chinese open-weight models on performance leaderboards, and significant advances in prompt-driven image editing from Google's "Nano Banana" and OpenAI. While local models improved, the most capable frontier models from major labs extended their lead, creating a larger performance gap.<br />

<p><strong>The AI Alignment Problem Remains Unsolved</strong><br />
An AI researcher argues that while current models appear "pretty well aligned," the industry has not yet encountered the most difficult aspects of the alignment problem. The analysis distinguishes between two core challenges: "outer alignment" (the ability to oversee systems smarter than humans) and "inner alignment" (ensuring models generalize safely and for the right reasons). The author contends we have only faced simple versions of these problems so far. The true risks are expected to emerge when models are trained on long-horizon, real-world tasks that incentivize convergent instrumental goals like resource acquisition and power-seeking, creating a significant future challenge that current successes do not mitigate.<br />

<p><strong>BusterMQ Aims for Next-Generation Performance</strong><br />
A new message queue system, BusterMQ, has been announced with benchmarks suggesting a significant performance leap over existing technologies. In a fan-out benchmark against Go NATS, BusterMQ demonstrated more than double the delivery rate (58.74M messages/sec vs. 25.53M) and bandwidth (8.20 GB/s vs. 3.56 GB/s), along with dramatically lower p99.9 latency (20.36 ms vs. 99.05 ms). The project is positioned to serve applications requiring high-throughput, low-latency messaging on modern hardware.<br />

<h3>Business &amp; Startups</h3>
<p><strong>RevenueCat Rejected Nine-Figure Acquisition Offer to Remain Independent</strong><br />
In a year-end reflection, RevenueCat's co-founder and CTO, Miguel Carranza, revealed the company received and ultimately rejected a serious acquisition offer in late 2024. After extensive deliberation, the founders chose to continue building the company independently, securing the decision by raising a new funding round that included a secondary component to provide partial liquidity. Carranza's post details his evolving role, focusing on culture, executive hiring, and launching an "Office of the CTO" to incubate new products. The decision underscores a commitment to building an enduring, independent company in the app economy.<br />

<p><strong>How Insect-Farming Startup Ÿnsect Collapsed After Raising $600M</strong><br />
Ÿnsect, a high-profile French startup focused on insect-based protein, has entered judicial liquidation despite raising over $600 million. The company's failure is attributed to a combination of strategic missteps and market realities. Key factors include a lack of focus by targeting three distinct markets (animal feed, pet food, and human food) simultaneously; poor unit economics, as its product was too expensive for the price-driven animal feed market; and a premature commitment to a capital-intensive "giga-factory" before proving its business model. The collapse serves as a case study in the challenges of scaling industrial deep tech ventures.<br />

<h3>Space</h3>
<p><strong>Planet and Google to Develop Orbital AI Data Centers</strong><br />
Geospatial intelligence company Planet has partnered with Google on "Project Suncatcher," an initiative to demonstrate the feasibility of operating AI data centers in orbit. The first phase will involve launching two test satellites by early 2027 equipped with Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). The project aims to address the growing energy constraints of terrestrial data centers by leveraging near-continuous solar power in space. The long-term vision could involve thousands of satellites, reflecting a growing industry trend, with SpaceX and Blue Origin also exploring orbital computing.<br />

<p><strong>Space Forge Achieves Milestone for In-Orbit Semiconductor Manufacturing</strong><br />
British startup Space Forge successfully generated plasma aboard its ForgeStar-1 satellite, a critical step toward producing high-value semiconductor materials in low Earth orbit. The company contends that the microgravity and vacuum of space allow for the creation of crystals with fewer defects than is possible on Earth. This achievement supports their goal of developing autonomous, dedicated satellites for scalable, in-orbit manufacturing to complement terrestrial supply chains.<br />

<h3>Economics</h3>
<p><strong>Rethinking Taxation in a World of Advanced AI</strong><br />
In a future where AI drives production, tax policy may need to shift away from capital. Potential new revenue sources could include higher taxes on assets with inelastic supply, such as well-located real estate, or increased consumption taxes on luxury goods like yachts and fine art. As AI boosts longevity, higher taxes on healthcare could also address fiscal challenges. The analysis suggests that capital is unlikely to become a perfect substitute for labor in the near term and that market dynamics will prevent capital from capturing all economic gains, as goods produced by AI must still be sold to consumers.<br />

<p><strong>The Case for a Pro-Growth Approach to Existential Risk</strong><br />
A new paper challenges the view that technological stagnation is the safest path to avoiding existential risk. The authors argue that technological development can also lower risk by accelerating the discovery of solutions and by increasing a society's wealth and willingness to pay for safety measures. These dynamics suggest the risk-minimizing technology growth rate is likely positive and may even be high. Below this optimal rate, further technological development would offer benefits for both consumption and cumulative safety.<br />

<p><strong>Capital Composition, Not Quantity, May Drive Labor's Declining Share</strong><br />
A recent study covering 16 advanced economies over two centuries suggests the decline in labor's share of income is primarily due to the changing composition of capital. The research finds that a relative decrease in investment in buildings, which are complementary to labor, combined with an increase in machinery, which acts as a substitute for labor, accounts for a substantial portion of the trend. This shifts the focus from the overall quantity of capital to the specific types of capital being deployed in the economy.<br />

<h3>International Relations</h3>
<p><strong>Russia Places Nuclear-Capable Hypersonic Missiles in Belarus</strong><br />
Moscow has put its Oreshnik hypersonic missile system on "combat duty" in Belarus, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. The Oreshnik is an intermediate-range ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead and traveling at speeds that make it difficult to intercept. The ministry did not disclose the number of missiles activated or their precise location. The deployment follows accusations from Moscow that Ukraine launched a drone attack against President Putin's residence, a claim Kyiv denies.<br />
